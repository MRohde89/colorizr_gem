## How does your gem take advantage of Rubyâ€™s metaprogramming capabilities?:

I used the metaprogramming in order to define a class hash into different methods. Instead of writing a method for each color. i was able to dynamically create the color method based on the @@colors hash

## How long did you spend working on this project?

This project was quite easy to solve! i was able to write the code, README in less than 2 hours. Without looking much into the details Ruby documentations. I really think, that i understood the principle of metaprogramming. 


## What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

The most rewarding challenge was the create_colors function, which has 3 lines of actual code and creates a bunch of new methods! To see that working was amazing!

## Where do you still have room to grow?

I think i still have room to grow in understanding all possibilities which are possible with metaprogramming. The detailed resources from Udacity were quite confusing, especially with the ```missing_method``` and ```super```
